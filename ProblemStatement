We utilize the AlgoTest web software for our algorithm backtesting, which is currently a time-consuming process. To streamline this, we are seeking a program or code that can automate the opening of 60 tabs, with each tab representing a minute-by-minute backtest.

Specific Requirements:
- When a strategy is backtested at 9:00 AM, the code should function to open 60 tabs, each with the strategy time incremented by one minute.
  - Example:
    - First tab: 9:00 AM
    - Second tab: 9:01 AM
    - Third tab: 9:02 AM
    - Fourth tab: 9:03 AM
    - Fifth tab: 9:04 AM
    - & so on..... till 10:00 AM
